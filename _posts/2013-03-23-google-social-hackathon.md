This time BITS Pilani's technical festival <a href="http://bits-apogee.org" target="_blank">APOGEE</a> was great fun. The Think Again lectures were great. There were many cool events as well. It was a very good experience overall. Luckily, our team participating in Google Social Hackathon got 2nd place. We made a social web app, "Social Food Sharing" which helps reduce wastage of food. I'll try and host this somewhere in near future. You can see the code <a href="https://github.com/aps-sids/Social-Food-Share-App" target="_blank">here</a>.
