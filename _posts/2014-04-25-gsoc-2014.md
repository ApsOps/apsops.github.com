Long time since I posted here. Partially due lack of time, partially due to lack of ideas and mostly due to my dead laptop :( Anyway, those days are long gone and I'm all set to rock \m/

I applied again this year to the same org TimVideos.us (awesome folks they are) and yeah, you guessed it right, my [proposal] is accepted. The project is quite challenging and I hope to do well and learn a lot.

Here's is my [GSoC progress blog] where I will be regularly posting about my work. Hope to have a great experience!

[proposal]: http://www.google-melange.com/gsoc/proposal/public/google/gsoc2014/sids/5668600916475904 "Port Flumotion to the gstreamer-1.x API"
