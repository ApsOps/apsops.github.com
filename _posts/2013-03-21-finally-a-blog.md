Phew.. So, after a long long wait, I finally have a blog! I always wanted to have a beautiful blog but as they say, using blogging services (blogger, tumblr..) is too mainstream :D It was only a few days back, I found the blog generator of my dreams, [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com). And since then I've been trying it out and with the help of some awesome people's open source repos, I've built it. And the best part is, I can host it on [Github Pages](http://pages.github.com) itself. Seems like I have a place to scribble now :P
