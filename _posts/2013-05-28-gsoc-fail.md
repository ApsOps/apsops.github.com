Google Summer of Code, commonly known as <a href="http://www.google-melange.com" target="_blank">GSoC</a>, is a global program that offers students stipends to write code for open source projects. This provides students a great opportunity to experience open source development and get a nice paycheck too! I applied for the same this year with this <a href="https://www.google-melange.com/gsoc/proposal/review/google/gsoc2013/sids/1" target="_blank">proposal</a>. Unfortunately, I couldn't get through :( But the whole application procedure and involvement enlightened me on so many levels. I got to interacts with many awesome people and know exactly how open source development goes on. I'll definitely apply again next year. Every student who likes to code and develop should give it a shot!
